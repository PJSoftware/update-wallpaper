# UpdateWallpaper.exe

Automate copying of Windows Spotlight and Bing images into Wallpaper Folder

## Usage

Usage of `UpdateWallpaper` has been vastly simplified from its earlier iterations.

All you need to do is place the `UpdateWallpaper.exe` file in a wallpaper folder (I use `C:\Wallpaper` and `X:\Wallpaper` on my machines, but _YMMV_) and run it from there.

If it finds Spotlight images it will create and update a `Spotlight` subfolder.

If it finds Bing images it will create and update a `Bing` subfolder.
